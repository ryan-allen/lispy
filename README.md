# LISPY

## Assumptions.

* People love libraries like Sinatra and ActiveRecord and Babushka and AASM and (name your favourite Ruby library).
* What they love about these is the small amount of Ruby syntax required to get a whole lot done.
* They love that they can contextualise their definitions (that make the libraries do things) with natural Ruby syntax such as blocks.
* To enable these kinds of libraries the use of so-called 'meta-programming' constructs are required (instance_eval, instance_exec).
* Clever but inexperienced Ruby programmers often make very useful libraries with wonderful APIs but horrible internals (my hand is up, see: Workflow).

## Goals.

* Decouple the language definition of an internal DSL from its implementation
* Allow library authors to dream up APIs and implement them without entering Ruby metaprogramming hell (it is a real place).

## Example
    class Feature < Test::Unit::TestCase
      # Configuring lispy to geenrate an AST for our language

      PROC_KEYWORDS = [:Given, :When, :Then, :And]
      KEYWORDS = [:Scenario, :Tag] + PROC_KEYWORDS

      extend Lispy
      acts_lispy :only => KEYWORDS, :retain_blocks_for => PROC_KEYWORDS

      # Using our language
      Scenario "this gets lispyified" do
        Given "something" do
        end

        Then "test something exists" do
          fail "ohai"
        end
      end
    end

    # Barfing out the AST for the above
    require 'rubygems'
    require 'awesome_print'
    ap Feature.output

    # Example 'interpreter' for the AST generated above
    # Executes the block on the Given and Then from above sequentially
    # Spike on how an acceptance testing DSL could work
    Feature.class_eval do
      def test_something
        scenario = Feature.output.expressions.first
        steps = scenario.scope.expressions
        instance_eval &steps[0].proc
        instance_eval &steps[1].proc
      end
    end

Your crazy so-called 'DSL' is now decoupled from your wonderfully explicitly programmed library, I hope. Because I might have to modify it one day and man, if I see a rats nest of instance_execs and auto-generated classes I might just... write you a nasty letter. With angry faces like this: >:|

## Now what?

If you have any questions about this, or how I'm using it for real-world problems (I am!), please get in touch. Pete won't talk to me about this, and I bought his car and everything!!!

## Why Lispy?

To my mind, this whole API fandangle we've gotten ourselves into is due to Ruby having a nice enough syntax to describe APIs in a way that is easy to understand, but Ruby itself wasn't designed with this usage in mind. When I see lines like `has_one :brain` and `dep 'nginx' do` it reminds me of a feature of LISP, which is code as data. Ruby doesn't have this code as data facility but I reckon if it did, we'd have cleaner library implementations with it's idomatic syntax.

Saying that, I've written about 10 lines of LISP in my life. Pete keeps telling me to go read SICP and I keep meaning to but then I end up at the local bar listening to some rock band and I'm like "crap, it's 3am". And even then, I wont get to use LISP at work because I don't think anyone in our company except for Pete has actually read SICP.
